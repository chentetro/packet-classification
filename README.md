# 📦 Packet Classification Project

This project focuses on **network packet classification** using **Machine Learning** in Python.  
The goal was to classify network traffic based on packet features into different categories.  

The project was implemented in a **Google Colab Notebook** and includes:
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**  
- Evaluation of model performance
